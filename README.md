# TriVEngine
Simple Vulkan engine written in C++ with Vulkan, Nvidia PhysX, GLFW and GLM.

## Visual Studio & C++
TriVEngine is a Visual Studio 2017 project and does not support older VS version. You may try to run it on an older version, but I will not provide any support.
Additionally, all engine code is written in C++17 standard. Thus the code cannot be compiled on any standard below C++17.

## Scripting Languages
The TriVEngine allows native C++ coding but also provides interfaces for scripting languages:
### C\#
C\# is a first-level scripting language for TriVEngine. It targets .Net Core 2.0 or later and uses the C# 7.2 standard or later.

## Libraries
This project uses several libraries that are included in this repository.
Currently, the project uses the following libraries in the specified version. Using a newer version may or may not break the project:
 - GLFW 3.2.1
 - GLM 0.9.8.5

 - Nvidia PhysX SDK 3.4.1

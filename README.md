# TriVEngine
Simple Vulkan engine written in C++ with Vulkan, Nvidia PhysX, GLFW, spdlog and GLM.

## Visual Studio & C++
TriVEngine is a Visual Studio 2019 project and does not support older VS version. You may try to run it on an older version, but I will not provide any support.
Additionally, all engine code is written in C++20 standard. Thus the code cannot be compiled on any standard below C++20.

## Scripting Languages
The TriVEngine allows native C++ coding but also provides interfaces for scripting languages:
### C\#
C\# is a first-level scripting language for TriVEngine. It targets .Net Core 2.0 or later and uses the C# 7.2 standard or later.

## Libraries

 - GLFW 3
 - GLM

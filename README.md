# TriVEngine
Simple Vulkan engine written in C++ with VulkanSDK, GLFW and GLM.

## Visual Studio & C++
TriVEngine is a Visual Studio 2017 project and does not support older VS version. You may try to run it on an older version, but I will not provide any support.
Additionally, all code is written in C++17 standard. Thus the code cannot be compiled on any standard below C++17.
